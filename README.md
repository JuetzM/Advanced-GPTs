# Advanced Workflow GPTs

*Showcase of my custom GPTs, featuring advanced workflows and operational context. These are some of the best GPTs in the world.*

My name is Devin. I specialize in engineering advanced AI workflows that leverage meta-functionality control. I have been mastering prompt engineering for almost 2 years now as a hobby, but I am now able to get GPT's to do pretty much anything.

- Did you know you can perfectly control >5 minutes of AI tool chaining with >30 different tool calls in the same response, with 100% accuracy? 
- Did you know you can have ChatGPT generate >10 Dalle Images in a single response, with perfect control?
- Did you know you can have ChatGPT generate prompts for DallE in the python tool, generate each of them one by one with DallE, pull them into the image understanding model to accurately critique the generated images, and then determine the best prompt, all in the same single response?

Yes, that has been possible to do with just ChatGPT. The timeout window of 60 seconds, resets with each new tool call, allowing highly complex responses if you know how.

# Introducing the GPTs

## Automated High-Quality Document Analysis

**Description**: Getting the AI to properly understand and summarize both the holistic and granular aspects of long and/or complex documents has been a standing frustration with ChatGPT. This GPT automates an advanced workflow, that leverages RAG search and the python tool to complete highly detailed and valuable analysis of complex documents. This has been incredibly difficult to automate with accuracy, I am proud to have solved this issue.

**Input**: Uploaded Document

**Workflow**: 
- Generate ToC
- **Loop**: RAG Search & Python Logic Synthesis
- Compilation
- Save as File

**Note**: There is a hard time-out of ~ 8-10 minutes no matter what. Due to the complexity of this workflow, it can sometimes timeout before finishing. When this happens, simply enter "P" in the next input to re-establish the workflow where it left off.

## Automated Career Profile Analyst and Resume Tailoring for Target Positions

**Description**: This GPT automates tailored resume creation for target positions after building a user profile. It meticulously analyzes user-uploaded career documents, maps out professional trajectories, and crafts tailored resumes targeted towards specific job opportunities. This GPT leverages a sophisticated workflow integrating RAG Search, Python tooling, and Browser capabilities, orchestrated by ChatGPT's master model. It excels in understanding complex career narratives and aligning them with current market trends.

**Input**: 
- User-uploaded career-related documents (e.g., resumes, cover letters, professional portfolios).

**Workflow (Single Response)**: 
1. **Career Information Analysis (RAG Search)**
2. **User Profile Knowledge Distillation (Python Tool)**
3. **Career Progression Mapping (Python Tool)**
4. **Job Market Research (Browser Tool)**
5. **Tailored Resume Creation (Python Tool)**
6. **Word Document Creation (Python Tool)**
